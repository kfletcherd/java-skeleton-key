# Skeleton Key
A very simple project I made for one purpose - to keep my computer awake without having to configure any settings on the OS. It simply opens a window to run in the background, and uses the Java Robot class to press the <ctrl> key (roughly) every minute and keep a few tallies for fun.

This was also a project used to experiment with JFrame themes and customizations.

The JAR file is included in this repo simply to avoid hastles with compiling with the icon.

# Warning
This project comes with no warrantes or gurantees. I made it for fun. Use at your own risk. You may experience undesireable effects if you are trying to use your control key when the robot fires.
